# Backend Code-Challenge

from my point of view the whole project needed a lot of refactoring. i did a lot, if i would spend even more time i could still do much more. but at some point overengineering would start.

most of my changes are explained in the controller, as from there processes start.
Actually i tried adding ApiPlatform, but there was a problem with the format of requests/responses, caused by ux-turbo, i think. could not fix it quickly, so i removed ApiPlatform again. would have been nice for the getMessages-Route though.

so checkout the controller and the other classes and i hope you like my version.
